- I wrote a scalable SMTP server from scratch, using NodeJS, and then deployed the server in a cloud infrastructure for processing the main spam flow. The maximum supported spam flow was increased by 30\%.
- Worked on improving the engines' scanning speed for large e-mails by changing the way signatures are done for this type of data. The speed increase was up to 50\% for very large e-mails.
- Developed an offensive speech detector using word2vec and LSTM networks to alert parents in case their children would get involved in dangerous conversations.
- Technologies used: C/C++, NodeJS, Python, *nix tools.
