- Responsible for enforcing the security of internal and external assets by conducting periodical pentesting operations. To this day, I was able to find 2 critical internal vulnerabilities that had an impact on all employees.
- I managed the vulnerabilities reported via the Bitdefender bug-bounty program. Because of my work, the average validation time was lowered to 3 days from 4 days.
- I monitored the network traffic within the company by setting up alerts in Splunk on the logs provided by Palo Alto and other internal tools. Because of this, 1 C\&C traffic was spotted and the communicating laptop proved to be infected with malware.
